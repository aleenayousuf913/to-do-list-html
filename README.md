I've been working on some web dev projects that I am excited to share! Here is a simple countdown timer with HTML, CSS, and Java

Set a time in minutes and watch the timer count down dynamically until it reaches zero.

Features

- Enter a custom time in minutes.
- Dynamic countdown displayed in `MM:SS` format.
- Alerts the user when the timer reaches zero.
- Simple and clean user interface.
